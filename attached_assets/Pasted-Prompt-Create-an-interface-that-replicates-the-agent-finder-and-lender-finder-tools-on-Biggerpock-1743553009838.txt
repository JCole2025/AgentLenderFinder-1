Prompt: 

Create an interface that replicates the agent finder and lender finder tools on Biggerpockets.com. It should have the same questions and same consumer flow. At the end take the information captured and put it into a webhook format. Each question should have a head and the answers to the questions should model the options that each question in the tool has. 

Include the following questions for agent finder: 

City, State 
Property Type
Are you looking to buy or sell a property? 
If buy, then ask - When are you looking to purchase? 
If sell, ask for the property address
What's your target purchase price? Min & Max
Have you started the loan process?
How many investment properties do you have?

More notes:When people complete the form store all of the information in a table in a database title "lead information" And also send a webhook with all of the lead information, I can provide the end point URL later. Make your own headers and data types based on the promot for now. The style should match what I provided. The form information should save midway and be saved to another table which is titled partial form fills - this should also be sent to an endpoint URL that I will define later - lake a variable to store all of the URL ends points that I will use later. Failed webhook submission should go into another table called "lead submission failures - also wait for me to send a URL end point to that - for now store in a database. 

This app needs to be an i-frame or widget that can easily be embedded into a website through a simple HTML code. 

To avoid bugs: 
All numeric data types like purchase price, should require a number. It should not accept alpha characters. Give the option for people to go back to correct fields. 


*Context*
A Complete Scalable Solution For Monetizing Leads From Demand Gen Partners Using a Webhook that Integrates With Concierge’s CRM. This requires more work from our concierge team and increases the cost to monetize leads. The variable cost will increase but we will be able to launch quickly (within 1-2 weeks of testing) and we will require no engineering effort. The lead gen partner will be required to do a small amount of technical work to launch their own lead capture method and send lead information via a webhook. In the future we can build an interface for partners who do not have the technical resources to deploy using a zapier interface that mimics our finder tools.
